# Hypoxia

A macOS utility to prevent digital eye strain by reminding you to blink regularly.

## What is Hypoxia?

Hypoxia is a lightweight menu bar application designed to help prevent corneal hypoxia - a condition that occurs when your eyes don't receive enough oxygen. When focusing on digital screens, people tend to blink less frequently (sometimes up to 60% less than normal), which can lead to dry eyes, eye strain, and corneal hypoxia.

## How It Works

Hypoxia runs discreetly in your menu bar and creates a transparent overlay across your screen that briefly "blinks" at configurable intervals. This visual reminder helps train you to blink more regularly while using your computer.

### Features

- **Non-intrusive**: Sits quietly in your menu bar with a minimal interface
- **Configurable intervals**: Choose from preset blink reminder intervals:
  - 30 seconds
  - 1 minute
  - 1.5 minutes
  - 2 minutes
- **Click-through design**: The blink animation won't interrupt your workflow or interfere with mouse interaction
- **Test functionality**: Test the blink animation at any time to see how it works

## Why Regular Blinking Matters

When you don't blink enough:
- Your eyes don't get properly lubricated with tears
- The cornea receives less oxygen
- Eye strain and dryness can develop more quickly
- Long-term digital eye strain can lead to more serious conditions

1. Download the latest release
2. Move Hypoxia.app to your Applications folder
